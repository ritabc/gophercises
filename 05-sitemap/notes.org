* Tasks
** DONE Implement flags
** DONE Read up on standard XML protocol - output simple static XML
** DONE Look into xml package
** DONE Think about struct and tackling cyclical links
** DONE Print HTML of page to console: How to get io.Reader with html from URL
    - client makes get, receives response
    - response.Body is io.ReadCloser
** Think about pre-xml data structures:
    - no need for tree struct
    - just need flat slice of all urls (not even text is needed)
** TODO Implement isDifferentDomain() func
* TODO IFF implementing bonus (with depth flag), we need to:
    - keep track of depth of each page 
    - in this case, our flat slice of urls will only indirectly achieved
    - our pre-XML data structure will be array of slices. 
        - Len(array) = max depth
        - each slice will contain all URLs found at that level
